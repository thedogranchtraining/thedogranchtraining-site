  <h1>Board &amp; Train</h1>

  <p>
    In our Board &amp; Train programs, your dog will stay at The Dog Ranch, where they will be taught
    and cared for by the owner and founder, Juliann. Juliann is a certified trainer specializing in
    dog obedience and behavior modification.
  </p>

  <p>
    During their stay, dogs are cared for not only by Juliann, but also by her family, and are treated
    and loved as if they were our own.
  </p>

  <p>
    Board &amp; Train is an excellent option for many dogs because it provides a stable, low-stress
    learning environment, which is crucial for building new behaviors and establishing a strong
    foundation of obedience.
  </p>
