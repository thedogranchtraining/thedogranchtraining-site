    <h1>Board &amp; Train</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        In our Board &amp; Train programs, your dog will stay at The Dog Ranch, where they will be taught and cared for by
        the owner and founder, Juliann. Juliann is a certified trainer specializing in dog obedience and behavior modification.
      </p>
      <p>
        During their stay, dogs are cared for not only by Juliann, but also by her family, and are treated and loved as if they were our own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Board &amp; Train is an excellent option for many dogs because it provides a stable, low-stress learning environment,
        which is crucial for building new behaviors and establishing a strong foundation of obedience.
