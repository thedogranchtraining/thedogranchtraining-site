  <h1>Our Services</h1>

  <h2>Board &amp; Train</h2>
  <p>
    Our Board &amp; Train programs offer an immersive training experience where dogs stay at The Ranch
    and receive focused, hands-on training. Programs are designed to build reliable obedience,
    improve manners, and establish a strong foundation for long-term success, all in a structured
    and low-stress environment.
  </p>

  <h2>Behavioral Consultation</h2>
  <p>
    Is your dog displaying unwanted or challenging behaviors? We offer behavioral consultations
    to help identify the underlying causes of these behaviors and develop a thoughtful,
    individualized plan to address them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Behavioral consultations are typically incorporated into our Board &amp; Train programs
    following an initial evaluation.
  </p>

  <h2>Refresher Options</h2>
  <p>
    Even well-trained dogs benefit from occasional practice and reinforcement. Our Refresher Options
    are available for dogs who have previously completed a Board &amp; Train program with us.
  </p>

  <p>Options include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Refresher Week</strong> – A focused week of dedicated training to reinforce and strengthen previously learned commands</li>
    <li><strong>Boarding with Maintenance</strong> – A boarding option that includes continued reinforcement of trained commands and manners</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Regular Boarding</h2>
  <p>
    Planning a trip? Our Regular Boarding option provides safe, comfortable overnight care
    for dogs who have not completed a Board &amp; Train program.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dogs stay in a calm, supervised environment and receive plenty of attention, care,
    and social interaction while you’re away.
  </p>

  <h2>Spa Specials</h2>
  <p>
    We also offer Spa Specials as optional add-ons to select services. These services help ensure
    your dog returns home clean, comfortable, and refreshed following their stay at The Dog Ranch.
