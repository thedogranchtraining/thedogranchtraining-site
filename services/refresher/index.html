<h1>Refresher Options</h1>

<p>
After your dog has completed one of our Board &amp; Train programs, they are eligible
for our Refresher Options. These programs are designed to reinforce previously learned
skills and help get your dog back on track.
</p>

<h2>Boarding with Maintenance</h2>

<p>
Once your dog has completed a Board &amp; Train program with The Dog Ranch, they may
qualify for our Boarding with Maintenance option. This is a great alternative to
standard boarding.
</p>

<p>
Your dog will stay with people they already know and trust while receiving maintenance
on commands and manners learned during their training.
</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> Discounted compared to Regular Boarding</p>

<h2>Refresher Week</h2>

<p>
After completing one of our training programs, your dog is eligible for a Refresher Week.
This is a great option if you have been unable to maintain your dog’s training at home.
</p>

<p>
During this week, we focus on retraining and reinforcing all previously learned skills.
This option differs from Boarding with Maintenance in that it includes dedicated,
structured training time each day.
</p>

<p>
A handover session is included at pickup to review the skills your dog has relearned and
to provide guidance for maintaining them at home.
