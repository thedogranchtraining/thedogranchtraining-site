  <h1>Refresher Options</h1>

  <p>
    After completing one of our Board &amp; Train programs, dogs are eligible for one of our
    Refresher options: <strong>Boarding with Maintenance</strong> or a
    <strong>Refresher Week</strong>. These options are designed to help maintain or reinforce
    the skills your dog has already learned with us.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Boarding with Maintenance</h2>

  <p>
    Once your dog has completed a Board &amp; Train program at The Dog Ranch, they may qualify
    for our Boarding with Maintenance option.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a great alternative to standard boarding. Your dog will stay with the people they
    already know and trust, while receiving continued reinforcement of the commands and manners
    learned during their previous training.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Price:</strong> Discounted compared to Regular Boarding
  </p>

  <p>
    To inquire about availability, call or text
    <a href="tel:14439350691">(443) 935-0691</a>
    or email
    <a href="mailto:TheDogRanchTraining@gmail.com">TheDogRanchTraining@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Refresher Week</h2>

  <p>
    After completing a Board &amp; Train program, your dog is also eligible for a Refresher Week.
    This option is ideal if you’ve found it challenging to consistently maintain your dog’s
    training at home.
  </p>

  <p>
    During a Refresher Week, we revisit and reinforce all of the skills your dog learned in their
    most recent Board &amp; Train program. Unlike Boarding with Maintenance, this option includes
    dedicated daily training time, focused on reteaching and strengthening skills that may have
    gone unmaintained.
  </p>

  <p>
    A handover session is included at pickup, during which we review the skills your dog has
    refreshed and provide guidance for handlers on how to continue maintaining them at home.
  </p>

  <p>
    Contact us for pricing to determine whether this option is the best fit for you and your dog.
