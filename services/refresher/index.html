    <h1>Refresher Options</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        After completing one of our Board &amp; Train programs, dogs are eligible for one of our Refresher options:
        Boarding with Maintenance or a Refresher Week. These options are designed to help maintain or reinforce the skills
        your dog has already learned with us.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Boarding with Maintenance</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Once your dog has completed a Board &amp; Train program at The Dog Ranch, they may qualify for our Boarding with Maintenance option.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a great alternative to standard boarding. Your dog will stay with the people they already know and trust,
        while receiving continued reinforcement of the commands and manners learned during their previous training.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Price:</strong> Discounted compared to Regular Boarding</p>
      <p>
        To inquire about availability, call or text <a href="tel:14439350691">(443) 935-0691</a> or email
        <a href="mailto:TheDogRanchTraining@gmail.com">TheDogRanchTraining@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Refresher Week</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        After completing a Board &amp; Train program, your dog is also eligible for a Refresher Week. This option is ideal if you’ve found it
        challenging to consistently maintain your dog’s training at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        During a Refresher Week, we revisit and reinforce all of the skills your dog learned in their most recent Board &amp; Train program.
        Unlike Boarding with Maintenance, this option includes dedicated daily training time, focused on reteaching and strengthening skills
        that may have gone unmaintained.
      </p>
      <p>
        A handover session is included at pickup, during which we review the skills your dog has refreshed and provide guidance for handlers
        on how to continue maintaining them at home.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Contact us for pricing</strong> to determine whether this option is the best fit for you and your dog.</p>
