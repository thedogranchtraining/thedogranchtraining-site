      <h2>Founding Owner</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Juliann, and I am the owner and founder of The Dog Ranch.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have grown up with dogs by my side for as long as I can remember. If you asked my younger self what I wanted
        to do when I grew up, the answer was always the same — something with dogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduating college, I moved back into my parents’ home and began my dog business there. Shortly after,
        my parents gently suggested that it might be time for me to find my own place to board dogs. 😊
      </p>
      <p>
        That led me to a small cottage on a farm, where a wonderful family gave me the opportunity to expand my dream
        of caring for and working with dogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a few years, I moved into my first home and continued welcoming dogs into my life, caring for them as if
        they were my own while their families were away.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the business grew, so did my family. We eventually moved into a larger home designed with dogs in mind —
        much to the delight of our canine guests and their owners. We are incredibly grateful for the trust our clients
        place in us. With our expanded space and property, we are now able to offer additional services, including
        obedience training and behavior modification.

      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p><strong>Our mission is two-fold:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          To help dogs and their owners build strong, healthy relationships through clear communication, consistent
          training, and structured guidance—allowing them to live full, balanced lives together.
        </li>
        <li>
          To extend the same care and love you have for your dog into our home, ensuring they feel safe, supported,
          and well cared for during their stay with us.
        </li>
