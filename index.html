    <h3>Founding Owner</h3>

    <p>
      Hi, my name is <strong>Juliann</strong>, and I am the owner and founder of The Dog Ranch.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have grown up with dogs by my side for as long as I can remember. If you asked my
      younger self what I wanted to do when I grew up, the answer was always the same —
      something with dogs.
    </p>

    <p>
      After graduating college, I moved back into my parents’ home and began my dog business
      there. Shortly after, my parents gently suggested that it might be time for me to find
      my own place to board dogs. 😊
    </p>

    <p>
      That led me to a small cottage on a farm, where a wonderful family gave me the
      opportunity to expand my dream of caring for and working with dogs.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a few years, I moved into my first home and continued welcoming dogs into my
      life, caring for them as if they were my own while their families were away.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the business grew, so did my family. We eventually moved into a larger home
      designed with dogs in mind — much to the delight of our canine guests and their
      owners. With our expanded space and property, we are now able to offer additional
      services, including obedience training and behavior modification.
    </p>

    <h3>Mission</h3>

    <p><strong>Our mission is two-fold:</strong></p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        To help dogs and their owners build strong, healthy relationships through clear
        communication, consistent training, and structured guidance — allowing them to live
        full, balanced lives together.
      </li>
      <li>
        To extend the same care and love you have for your dog into our home, ensuring they
        feel safe, supported, and well cared for during their stay with us.
      </li>
    </ol>
